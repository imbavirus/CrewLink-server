<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the relay server for CrewLink, an Among Us proximity voice chat program. I am currently hosting a server at `https://crewl.ink/`, but if you want a more reliable option I would suggest to deploy this repository yourself.

## Environment Variables

Optional environment variables:

 - `PORT`: Specifies the port that the server runs on. Defaults to `443` if `HTTPS` is enabled, and `9736` if not.
 - `HOSTNAME` **(REQUIRED)**: The hostname or IP of the server (a record without a proxy so if you have cloudflare make a extra dns record named for example direct.domain.com and disable the proxy for that record (this is for the turn server))
 - `NAME`: Specifies the server name
 - `HTTPS`: Enables https. You must place `privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem` in your CWD.
 - `SSLPATH`: Specifies an alternate path to SSL certificates.

## Deploy to Heroku

To get up and running quickly, you can deploy to Heroku using the button below

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This will deploy an instance of the crewlink-server. You can get the URL of your server by using the app name that you gave when you launched the app on heroku and appending `.herokuapp.com`. You can also find the URL of your server by going to "Settings", scrolling down to "Domains". Using this URL, follow step 4 of the [installation instructions](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/CrewLink-server#manual-installation) to connect your client to your server instance.

## Docker Quickstart

Run the server with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) by running the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 9736:9736 ohmyguus/bettercrewlink-server:latest
```

To change the external port the server uses, change the *first* instance of the port. For example, to use port 8123:

```
docker run -d -p 8123:9736 ohmyguus/bettercrewlink-server:latest
```

### Building the Docker Image

To build your own Docker image, do the following:

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink-server.git
cd BetterCrewLink-server
```

2. Run the Docker build command:
```sh
docker build -t ohmyguus/bettercrewlink-server:build .
```

## Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* yarn
```sh
npm install yarn -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OhMyGuus/crewlink-server.git
cd crewlink-server
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
yarn install
```
3. Compile and run the project
```JS
yarn start
```
4. Copy your server URL into CrewLink settings. Make sure everyone in your lobby is using the same server.
### Customizing Peer to Peer Behavior
By default CrewLink clients will attempt to establish connections directly to each other for sending voice and game 
state data. As a fallback mechanism, CrewLink-server ships with an integrated TURN server in the event clients cannot
directly connect to each other. You may want to customize this behavior to, for example, exclusively use the TURN relay
to protect player IP addresses. To do so, head into the ``config`` folder and rename ``peerConfig.example.yml`` to
``peerConfig.yml`` and make the desired changes.
